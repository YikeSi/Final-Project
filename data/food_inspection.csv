Ware washing staff taking clean food contact services e.i dishes  pots  pans  etc. and not removing non disposable gloves. Observed no hand washing performed during inspection. Educate food handlers and employees in proper hand washing and glove use.  Proper Glove Use 		     Food Service Establishments Training Tips  Single-use disposable gloves have become a popular way to abide by the  _o bare hand contact of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods._regulation.  Single- use gloves are only as clean as the hands that don them. Washing hands thoroughly before and after wearing or changing gloves is one of the most important things food handlers can do. However  some food operators may get a false sense of security  or worse yet; use gloves as an excuse not to properly wash their hands and overuse the single-use gloves  thus defeating their purpose. Gloves are in fact an excellent way to reduce the possibility of contaminating ready-to-eat foods and serve as an extra precautionary measure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  _loves reduce hand contamination by 70 to 80%  and prevent cross-contamination_ But  the key to their efficacy is coupled with proper hygienic practices.  Some important tips to remember;  _Gloves are task specific and should NEVER be worn continuously. They get contaminated just as bare hands do  so change them out frequently. _Wash your hands properly in between these changes  i.e. (a 20 second scrub with soap  warm water and don_ forget to dry off with a clean paper towel). _Gloves are not a stand-alone protective barrier. As mentioned above  they are not 100% effective  but when combined with proper hand washing they significantly reduce the possibility of contaminating your customer_ food. _Gloves can still cross-contaminate. Don_ touch the ready-to-eat food if you have just handled a raw piece of meat or eggs. Throw away the gloves  wash your hands  and put on a new pair. _If you touch a dirty surface with your glove (hair  nose  clothing  floor  equipment or utensils) the glove is dirty and you need to change them after washing your hands. _Bacteria from your skin continue to grow while underneath the gloves and that is why it is important to wash between handling the new gloves. Don_ pre-contaminate your gloves. _Non-latex gloves are recommended in Massachusetts. Keep a box of gloves in a readily accessible area. Perhaps by the hand wash sink. Being careful not to contaminate them here either. _Gloves used for food contact should not be used for money  trash  cleaning of soiled",686   Washington ST,Boston,MA,2111,155995,"(42.351311, -71.06264)"EMPIRE GARDEN,,,Wong,David,20857,1/4/12 18:59,12/31/15 23:59,Active,FS,Eating & Drinking,HE_Pass,15-4-202.16,*,Non-Food Contact Surfaces,3/20/15 11:47,Pass,3/23/15 8:30,Cardboard observed being used to line the floor of the walk-in cooler.
